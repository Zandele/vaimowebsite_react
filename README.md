I started off my project with basic Html, Vanilla Java and CSS. This is what we used on campus and all I know, but it soon become apparent that itâ€™s hard to fetch and use the data from the API and that my mobile version would not display. I decided to start learning and doing research about 'React' and found that it is much easier to grasp with its component-based approach.
So, I started from scratch last minute and wasted countless of hours on the first design. A day before my submission I started with my React design, not expecting much but it soon became apparent that this a more practical design.
My submission was extended with an extra 2 days and this is the current state I reached with the time allocated. I believe if I started with react from the beginning, the results would be VASTLY better.
All I would change about this project was the time frame in which I started to learn and create the final design.
